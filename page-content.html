			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">What is it that has caused so much success against competitors?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">Which competitors worry you the most, why?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">What keeps Payhawk ahead?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">Why does Payhawk lose deals?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">Which products or features would unlock the most value? How/why?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">Which features are customers using the most?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">Do the most used features correlate to the highest revenue in some way?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">Would be great to see a competitor analysis. I see this page but itâ€™s focus only on comparing to traditional systems, not fintech competitors. How is Payhawk different and how does it solve customer problems?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">Are there efforts in place to convert non-issued card volume to issued card volume?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">Is there interchange share with customers?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">Getting network incentives from Visa? Are they good?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">How best to stay up on news in the space?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">Targeting G2 at all?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">Where does bank transfer volume come from? How do we monetize it?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">Is there a formal leadership team, who is on it? What types of things does this team do?</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">Seems like there&#39;s an opportunity to get much more numbers focused from a rev perspective</p>
			<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">Do we need to make a decision regarding how much we aim to target interchange revenue? Noting that having more interchange based revenue has impact on valuation multiples vs SaaS</p>
